# Start Page
_A simple website for regularly used links, for people who don't like using bookmarks._

This repository is aimed at being a simple template/framework that others can copy to get a very basic site up and running to host their own Start Page.

Your Start Page, is a web page you can set your browser to open when you open a new tab. It'll have your regularly used links, or links you want to keep handy, close at hand so you don't need to go hunting for them (or remember them).

The inital concept is to use GitHub pages; this concept may change.
